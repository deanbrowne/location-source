#summary Release policies and version history.

= Policies =

=== Version Numbering ===

Location Source follows the `major.minor.fix` version numbering convention.  For example 2.0.4 would mean the second major release, first minor release for this major release, and fourth bug fixing patch.
 * _Major releases_ correspond to the Location API version; currently JSR-179 defines version 1 and there is no version 2
 * _Minor releases_ implement new parts of the spec or support new platforms
 * _Fix releases_ only fix bugs
